<h1>IBTrACS data</h1>
<p>In this lecture we use data from the <strong>International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship</strong> or IBTrACS for short.</p>

<p>IBTrACS is the most complete global collection of tropical cyclones available, and it is developed collaboratively with all the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers, as well as other organizations and individuals from around the world.</p>

<li><p>lines: <code>IBTrACS.NA.list.v04r01.lines.zip</code></p></li>

<p>Notice that IBTrACS data has many more tropical cyclones than those in <code>storms</code>. Why? Because IBTrACS contains systems of low wind speed (i.e.&nbsp;baby storms that never became big enough to be named).</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the <code>"sf"</code> object <code>ibtracs</code> is that we can also pass this to <code>geom_sf()</code>. As you can tell, <code>geom_sf()</code> understands that <code>ibtracs_1975</code> is a data set in standard <strong>vector format</strong>. This means that we don’t need to specify anything for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes. Isn’t that cool?</p>
